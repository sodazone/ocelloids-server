TODO
====

[] Remove processing logic on new blocks
[] Store bounded cache of new blocks on our database (binary Uint8Array)
[] Processing logic on finalized blocks, retrieve from database (Smoldot best block peers problem)
[] Continuous catch-up on finalized blocks stream, Smoldot skips finalized numbers (why?)
[] Start up catch-up from finalized head in background, one-shot only on start, pass it to finalezed block processing logic
[] Resilient catch-up logic, cases (1) stops catch-up in the middle (2) getBlock fails, retries (max retries and alert of unrecoverable gap?)
[] Load default configuration by environment var, e.g. config/development.toml
[] Follow all destinations logic
[] Update subscriptions (API + logic)
[] Allow updating control queries for senders and destinations
[] Notifications models and webhook client (retries etc.)
[] Handle modifications in network configuration (?)
[] Handle smoldot panics
